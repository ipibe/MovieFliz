## App Walkthrough GIF

Week 1

For the first week I learned how to start an app and understand how to fetch data from the website The Movie Database API.
I was able to put the movies that are recently being played on theaters as well as a brief description.

Week 2

Continuing into the same project, I was able to expand and add a backdrop images and poster for the movies that are playing.
Also, I added a tab Nav bar which seperates two items which one is "Now playing" and the second one is "superheros" showing a list of all the superhero movies the website is offering.
